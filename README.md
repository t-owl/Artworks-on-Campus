# Artworks-on-Campus
IOS app for finding the different artwork across campus

This application consists of three screens, the main screen “University of Liverpool Art Map” the
secondary screen “Detail Page” and the third screen “The multiple Artwork selection”

1. Once the app is opened, the user is presented with the main screen “University of Liverpool Art Map” which consists of a map centred on their current location and at a reasonable level of zoom so that nearby roads.

   The map contains a number of annotation marks indicating the location of nearby artworks.
   
   In portrait view, a table below the map contains a list of artworks, grouped by building and ordered by distance from the current location.
   A search box allows the user to filter the items displayed in the table

2. Tapping on an annotation displays an image and information either about a specific artwork, or else sensibly handles the fact that the annotation represents multiple artworks. One way to do the latter is to present a list of artworks available within the building, selecting any of which then displays an image and information about the selected artwork

3. When a location contains multiple art, the app presents to the user a list with all the art available in the selected location
